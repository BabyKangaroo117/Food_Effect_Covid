# Correlations of diet on Covid infection rate

Covid was an unexpected pandemic that was left untreated for many months until a vaccine and other medications were developed. What if there were some 
preventative measure that could be taken that are non pharmaceutical. This project tries to see if there is a correlation between a countries diet and 
its Covid infection rate. An analysis on the data will be done and then a model will be developed to see if we can make predictions on future outcomes. 

**Note**: This project doesn't intend to conclude that diet is the determing factor of covid infection. We are trying to reveal correlations that can be
further researched by scientists to see *if* the food may have effects on covid cases.
