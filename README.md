# How diet can effect Covid infection rate

Covid was an unexpected pandemic that was left untreated for many months until a vaccine and other medications were developed. What if there were some 
preventative measure that could be taken that are non pharmaceutical. This project tries to see if there is a correlation between a countries diet and 
its Covid infection rate. An analysis on the data will be done and then a model will be developed to see if we can make predictions on future outcomes.
